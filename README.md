## My process

First I formatted the HTML to reflect semantic tags. I then used the style-guide in order to create custom properties to use throughout the css. This helped to limit the number of properties I typed out and allowed me to easily manage sizing for the fonts without having to change in multiple areas. By developing mobile-first, I was able to adjust my styling according to the width of a desktop with minimal adjustments.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

## Useful resources

The primary resource I utilized to build out this project was the MDN web documentation in order to reference aspects of applying properties and specifically understanding how to apply custom css properties.
